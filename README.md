# Daily DSA Practice — Java
This repository contains my **Daily Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice** using **Java**.
Every day I solve **at least one DSA problem** from platforms like **GeeksforGeeks (GfG)** and **LeetCode**, take detailed notes, understand the core logic, and implement optimized Java solutions.

## 🎯 Goal
The primary goal of this repo is to:
- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Practice consistent coding discipline
- Learn time and space optimization techniques
- Track daily progress
- 
## 📅 Practice Routine
Every day I follow a 1-hour routine:

| Time Spent |                        Activity |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| 30 mins    | Understand problem + take notes |
| 30 mins    |      Implement solution in Java |

## 📌 How I Solve Problems
For each problem I follow this workflow:
1. **Understand the problem statement**  
2. **Analyze constraints and edge cases**  
3. **Choose correct data structures (Arrays, HashMaps, Trees, DP, etc.)**  
4. **Write pseudocode in notes**  
5. **Implement solution in Java**  
6. **Test on sample and corner cases**  
7. **Optimize time & space complexity**
